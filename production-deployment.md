npm run deploy:production
```

#### Health Check Script
```bash
curl -f https://your-domain.com/api/health || exit 1
curl -f https://your-domain.com/api/ai/oracle/health || exit 1
curl -f https://your-domain.com/api/performance/load-testing?type=system_health || exit 1
```

### Post-Deployment Verification

- [ ] League creation and management
- [ ] Player data and projections
- [ ] Trade analysis and recommendations

#### 2. AI Services Tests
- [ ] Oracle predictions and recommendations
- [ ] Auto-draft functionality
- [ ] Trade intelligence and analysis
- [ ] User behavior analysis and personalization

#### 3. Performance Tests
- [ ] Response times under load
- [ ] Database query performance
- [ ] Caching effectiveness
- [ ] Error rates and fallback systems

#### 4. Integration Tests
- [ ] All AI services working together
- [ ] Real-time data updates
- [ ] WebSocket connections for live features
- [ ] External API integrations

### Monitoring and Alerting

#### Critical Metrics to Monitor
- Response time (target: <500ms for 95% of requests)
- Error rate (target: <1% for all endpoints)
- AI accuracy scores (target: >85% for all services)
- Database connection health
- Cache hit rates (target: >80%)
- User engagement metrics

#### Alert Configuration
- Response time >1000ms for >5 minutes
- Error rate >5% for >2 minutes
- AI service failures >3 consecutive attempts
- Database connection failures
- Memory usage >85% for >10 minutes
- Disk usage >90%

### Rollback Procedures

#### Quick Rollback
```bash
# Rollback to previous version
npm run rollback:previous

# Rollback database migrations
npm run db:rollback
```

#### Emergency Procedures
1. Disable AI features if core functionality affected
2. Switch to cached/static responses for critical paths
3. Scale down AI processing if resource issues
4. Enable maintenance mode if system-wide issues

### Continuous Improvement

#### Performance Optimization
- Monitor and optimize slow database queries
- Implement additional caching layers as needed
- Optimize AI model selection based on accuracy vs cost
- Fine-tune rate limiting and resource allocation

#### Feature Enhancement
- A/B test new AI features with subset of users
- Gradually roll out improvements to AI models
- Collect user feedback and usage analytics
- Implement continuous learning improvements

#### Scalability Planning
- Monitor resource usage and plan for scaling
- Implement horizontal scaling for AI services
- Consider implementing service mesh for microservices
- Plan for multi-region deployment if needed
