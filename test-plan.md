## **READY TO START TESTING!**

Your Astral Field app is running at **http://localhost:3007**

Begin with the authentication system and work through each major feature systematically. The SportsDataIO integration is a key new feature that needs thorough testing.

Remember to test both the happy path (everything works) and edge cases (what happens when things go wrong).
