## 🔧 TECHNICAL VERIFICATION

### API Endpoints Working:
- [ ] `GET /api/sync-sportsdata` - SportsData status
- [ ] `GET /api/players/search?query=test` - Player search

- [ ] `POST /api/ai/chat` - AI chat functionality (requires API key)

### Service Worker Verification:
```javascript
// Run in browser console on any page:
navigator.serviceWorker.getRegistrations().then(registrations => {
  console.log('SW Registrations:', registrations);
  console.log('SW Active:', registrations[0]?.active?.state);
});
```

### PWA Verification:
```javascript
// Check PWA installability in console:
window.addEventListener('beforeinstallprompt', (e) => {
  console.log('PWA installable!', e);
});
```

## 🐛 KNOWN ISSUES & LIMITATIONS

### Current Limitations:
1. **AI Oracle requires API key** - Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_OPENAI_API_KEY` in `.env.local`
2. **Player data** - Uses existing database, enhanced with SportsDataIO integration
3. **Offline functionality** - Basic caching, limited without network
4. **PWA icons** - Using default icons, custom icons can be added

### Testing Notes:
- **AI Oracle**: Will show connection error without API key (expected behavior)
- **Player Search**: Works with existing player database
- **PWA Install**: Only shows on HTTPS or localhost
- **Service Worker**: May need hard refresh on first install

## 📞 TROUBLESHOOTING

### If AI Oracle doesn't work:
1. Check `.env.local` has `NEXT_PUBLIC_OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key`
2. Restart dev server: `npm run dev`
3. Check browser console for API errors

### If PWA install prompt doesn't appear:
1. Use Chrome or Edge browser
2. Wait 10 seconds after page load
3. Check DevTools > Application > Manifest

### If player search is slow:
1. Check network tab for API response times
2. Database may need player data sync
3. Try simpler search terms first

### If service worker issues:
1. Go to DevTools > Application > Service Workers
2. Click "Unregister" then refresh page
3. SW should re-register automatically
